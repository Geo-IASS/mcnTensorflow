### Working progress towards a Tensorflow importer

This is a collection of scripts that constitute a working progress towards a
Tensorflow importer for Matconvnet.  Unfortunately they are not in a usable 
state, but they may prove useful as a starting point if you are trying to 
write your own.

Note: Matconvnet importers exist for [caffe](https://github.com/vlfeat/matconvnet/blob/master/utils/import-caffe.py) 
and [PyTorch](https://github.com/albanie/mcnPyTorch), so if you can find the 
desired model there, the path will be less treacherous.
